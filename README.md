# ECommSite
E-Commerce Site built as a final project for a course using Java Servlets, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project was created during the last two weeks of the semester and was created alongside another group member while the two other memebers worked on the report (included in the repository). It has not been deployed due to lack of work from one of the group members, however, I am currently working on converting the site to a deployable version and launching it soon. Once that is done the plan is to convert it to react to demonstrate a basic understanding of the framework while keeping the original blueprint mentioned in the report.
